      <h4 class="article">
        React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who
        released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS".[35][36] He was
        influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first
        deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in
        2012.[37] It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.[36] React
        Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with
        React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and
        open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React
        Fiber, a new core algorithm of React library for building user
        interfaces.[38] React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future
        improvements and feature development of the React library.[39][needs
        update] On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the
        public.[40] On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the
        public.[41] The release introduced React Hooks.[42] On August 10, 2020,
        the React team announced the first release candidate for React v17.0,
        notable as the first major release without major changes to the React
        developer-facing API.[43]
