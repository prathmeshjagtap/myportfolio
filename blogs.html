          <p>
            This is the Dummy blogs . The React 17 release is unusual because it
            doesn‚Äôt add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release
            is primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. In
            particular, React 17 is a ‚Äústepping stone‚Äù release that makes it
            safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree
            managed by a different version of React. It also makes it easier to
            embed React into apps built with other technologies.

            This is the Dummy blogs . Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one
            of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript
            enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
            applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side
            page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated
            JavaScript engine to execute it.

          <h1>The $100 Startup</h1>
          <small>July 25, 2020</small>
          <p>
            The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau is the refreshingly different
            book than what I expected it to be . Its not going to teach you how
            to be a millionaire . It's a simple approach to starting a business
            , aimed to people who don't know where to start and don't have a lot
            of money to play with . In short its goes to the most important part
            that is how to start getting sh*t done. .

          <small>August 02, 2020</small>
          <p>
            In His Book The Creative Curve Allen Gannett Destroys the myth that
            the ideas comes to us by the light bulb effect üí° . He tells us that
            world changing ideas are not born by the mere coincidence but are
            the effect of 4 important laws ,Consumption ,Imitation, Creative
            communities and Iterations . To explain this he has drawn a creative
            curve for the better understanding
